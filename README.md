Wireframing is the process of creating a simplified, skeletal outline of a design for a website, application, or other digital product. It serves as a blueprint, focusing on layout, structure, and functionality without the distraction of visual details like colors, fonts, or images.

Why is Wireframing Important?

Clarifies Design Goals: Wireframes help designers and stakeholders focus on the core objectives and functionality of the product.
Improves Communication: They provide a visual representation that facilitates collaboration among designers, developers, and clients.
Saves Time and Resources: By identifying potential issues early, wireframing reduces the need for costly revisions later in the process.
Enhances User Experience: It allows designers to plan intuitive navigation and ensure the layout meets user needs.
Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process, bridging the gap between concept and final product.# wireframing
